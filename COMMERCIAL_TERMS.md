# ⚖️ COMMERCIAL TERMS & LICENSING AGREEMENT
**Protocol:** VCTR-SOV (Universal Settlement Engine)
**Architect:** 975A
**Effective Date:** February 2026

## 1. THE PROTOCOL SUSTAINABILITY CONSTANT (PSC)
To ensure the continuous latency-free operation, cryptographic integrity, and legal defense of the VCTR-SOV network, all Commercial Integrations agree to remit a licensing fee on generated revenue.

**The Fee:** **1.5% of Gross Revenue** derived from verification events.
*(Example: If an app charges users $1.00 to verify ID, $0.015 is automatically routed to the Protocol Reserve).*

## 2. REVENUE ALLOCATION (THE SPLIT)
The 1.5% PSC is strictly allocated to the following operational verticals:

* **0.5% - Core Development & Operations:** Allocated for immediate infrastructure costs, hardware maintenance, and Architect compensation to ensure 24/7 protocol uptime.
  
* **0.5% - Legal Defense & IP Reserve:** Restricted capital designated for intellectual property protection, regulatory compliance, and defense against adversarial vector attacks.
  
* **0.5% - Treasury & Asset Backing:** Long-term capital reserve held to collateralize the protocol's future value and ensure ecosystem stability.

**Primary Payment Address (Solana/SPL):**

## 3. NON-COMMERCIAL USE (FREE TIER)
* **Personal & Research Use:** Free.
* **Non-Profit/Humanitarian:** Free.
* *Condition:* Attribution to "VCTR-SOV Protocol by 975A" is required in the application UI.

## 4. FOUNDER RETAINED INTEREST ("THE GOLDEN SHARE")
In the event of an acquisition, merger, or sale of the VCTR-SOV technology:
* The Architect retains a **5.0% Perpetual Royalty** on the protocol's core IP logic (`975ad5a` hashing method), regardless of transfer of ownership.
* This clause is irrevocable and survives any bankruptcy or restructuring event.

## 5. ENFORCEMENT
Failure to remit the PSC constitutes a breach of license. The Protocol Architect reserves the right to revoke API access and blacklist the offending application's UUIDs from the verification network without notice.
