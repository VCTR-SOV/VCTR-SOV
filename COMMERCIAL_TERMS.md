## 1. THE SOVEREIGN LICENSE (Dual-Mode Structure)
To protect the integrity of the 975ad5a logic, this Protocol operates under a strict Dual-License model:
* **Open Source (GPL-3.0):** The Core Logic is free for non-profit, educational, and personal Sovereign self-verification. "The Code belongs to the People."
* **Commercial Sector License:** Any entity using VCTR-SOV™ logic, branding, or kinetic verification standards for **profit generation** must operate under a valid **Commercial Node License**.

## 2. THE PROTOCOL SUSTAINABILITY CONSTANT (The 1% Reserve)
The Architect maintains the immutable right to the **Genesis Constant** to ensure the long-term defense, technical maintenance, and sovereignty of the Network.

    3.  **The Maya Fund:** Providing hardware access and infrastructure support for unhoused and nomadic users.
