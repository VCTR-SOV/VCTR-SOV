# ⚖️ VCTR-SOV™ PROTOCOL CONSTITUTION (The Settlement)

**Effective Date:** 2026-02-04  
**Architect:** Michael Joel Lewis [975A]  
**Protocol Standard:** 975ad5a  

---

## 1. THE SOVEREIGN LICENSE (Dual-Mode Structure)
To protect the integrity of the 975ad5a logic, this Protocol operates under a strict Dual-License model:
* **Open Source (GPL-3.0):** The Core Logic is free for non-profit, educational, and personal Sovereign self-verification. "The Code belongs to the People."
* **Commercial Sector License:** Any entity using VCTR-SOV™ logic, branding, or kinetic verification standards for **profit generation** (e.g., Corporate Access, Fintech, Social Verification, or Data Monetization) must operate under a valid **Commercial Node License**.

## 2. THE PROTOCOL SUSTAINABILITY CONSTANT (The 1% Reserve)
The Architect maintains the immutable right to the **Genesis Constant** to ensure the long-term defense, technical maintenance, and sovereignty of the Network.
* **The Rule:** **1.0% of Gross Revenue** generated by any Commercial Sector Node must be remitted to the Genesis Reserve.
* **The Purpose:** This fund is strictly designated for:
    1.  **Legal Defense:** Protecting the 975ad5a standard and its users against hostile corporate litigation or patent trolling.
    2.  **Infrastructure Grants:** Funding the open-source builders who maintain the Core Logic.
    3.  **The Maya Fund:** Providing hardware access and infrastructure support for unhoused and nomadic users.

## 3. SECTOR OWNERSHIP (Digital Real Estate)
* **The Builder's Right:** Developers who build "Sectors" (Modules/Nodes) retain **99% of the revenue** and **100% of the Intellectual Property** for their specific interface and additive code.
* **The Architect's Right:** The Architect retains sole ownership of the **VCTR-SOV™ Trademark**, the **975ad5a Protocol Standard**, and the **Genesis Constant**.

## 4. REGULATORY NEUTRALITY (The Oracle Clause)
* **Protocol Neutrality:** VCTR-SOV™ is a Pure Identity Oracle. It provides a "Verification of Physics" attestation. It does not store, transmit, or settle financial instruments.
* **Compliance Responsibility:** Node Operators (Sectors) are independently responsible for local KYC/AML compliance. VCTR-SOV™ is a neutral utility standard, equivalent to GPS or HTTPS, and is not a financial intermediary.

## 5. THE GENESIS RESERVE (Settlement & Grants)
Until the Automated Settlement Smart Contract is deployed, all manual 1% fees and funding grants must be remitted to the official Genesis address:

### 🏦 Official Settlement Address
**Network:** [e.g., Solana / Ethereum / Bitcoin]  
**Address:** `[PASTE YOUR WALLET ADDRESS HERE]`
