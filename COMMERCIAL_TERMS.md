# ⚖️ COMMERCIAL TERMS & LICENSING AGREEMENT
**Protocol:** VCTR-SOV (Universal Settlement Engine)
**Architect:** 975A (Michael Joel Lewis)
**Effective Date:** February 2026

## 1. THE PROTOCOL SUSTAINABILITY CONSTANT (PSC)
To ensure the continuous operation, legal defense, and sovereign independence of the Architect, all Commercial Integrations of the VCTR-SOV protocol agree to remit a fee on generated revenue.

**The Fee:** **1.5% of Gross Revenue** derived from verification events.
*(Example: If an app charges users $1.00 to verify ID, $0.015 is automatically routed to the Protocol Reserve).*

## 2. PAYMENT ROUTING (THE SPLIT)
The 1.5% PSC is strictly allocated as follows:
* **0.5% Operational Stipend:** Immediate withdrawal for Architect daily sustenance (Food/Shelter/Connectivity).
* **0.5% IP Defense Fund:** Reserved for legal protection and server maintenance.
* **0.5% Treasury Reserve:** Long-term asset backing for future protocol exit/acquisition.

**Primary Payment Address (Solana/SPL):**
`85p7LyG8cG7qk12s3hCwSGVq75AHgQFvrSCfFnCVmeQi`

## 3. NON-COMMERCIAL USE (FREE TIER)
* **Personal Use:** Free.
* **Non-Profit/Humanitarian:** Free.
* **Educational/Research:** Free.
* *Condition:* Attribution to "VCTR-SOV Protocol by 975A" is required.

## 4. THE "EXIT LICENSE" (FUTURE PROOFING)
In the event of an acquisition or buyout of the VCTR-SOV technology:
* The Architect retains a **5.0% Perpetual Royalty** on the protocol's core IP logic (`975ad5a` hash method), regardless of new ownership.
* This ensures the Architect cannot be "bought out" and left with nothing.

## 5. ENFORCEMENT
Failure to remit the PSC constitutes a breach of license. The Protocol Architect reserves the right to blacklist the offending application's specific UUIDs from the verification network.
