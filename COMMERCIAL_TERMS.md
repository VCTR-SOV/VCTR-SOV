## 1. THE SOVEREIGN LICENSE (Dual-Mode Structure)
To protect the integrity of the 975ad5a logic, this Protocol operates under a strict Dual-License model:

* **Open Source (GPL-3.0):** The Core Logic is free for non-profit, educational, and personal Sovereign self-verification. "The Code belongs to the People."
* **Commercial Sector License:** Any entity using VCTR-SOV logic, branding, or kinetic verification standards for **profit generation** (e.g., Corporate Access, Fintech, Social Verification, Ticketing, or Data Sales) must operate under a valid **Node License**.

## 2. THE GENESIS FEE (The 1% Constant)
The Architect (Michael Joel Lewis) retains the immutable right to the **Genesis Constant**.

* **The Rule:** **1.0% of Gross Revenue** generated by any Commercial Sector Node must be remitted to the Genesis Reserve.
* **Application:** This applies to:
    * Licensing fees collected by Developers.
    * Transaction fees processed through the Node.
    * Data monetization revenue derived from "Sovereign" verifications.

## 3. SECTOR OWNERSHIP (Digital Real Estate)
* **The Builder's Right:** Developers who build "Sectors" (Modules/Nodes) retain **99% of the revenue** and **100% of the Intellectual Property** for their specific interface and code.
* **The Architect's Right:** The Architect retains sole ownership of the **VCTR-SOV™ Trademark**, the **975ad5a Protocol Standard**, and the **Genesis Constant**.

## 4. THE GENESIS RESERVE (Settlement & Grants)
