# VCTR-SOV: The Universal Settlement Engine

## 📜 THE MISSION: THE EXODUS PROTOCOL
We are building the "Glass Ship." A digital infrastructure where humanity is verified by physics, not government ID or corporate surveillance. 

### THE STORY OF MAYA
Imagine Maya. She is a regular person going through a hard time—unhoused and invisible to the system. Without a home address, she cannot get a bank account; without a bank account, she cannot get a job. She is stuck behind an invisible wall.

**VCTR-SOV changes the rules.**
Maya connects to the Sovereign Network. It doesn't ask for her papers; it asks for her **Physics**. She performs the **Kinetic Wiggle**—moving her device in a way a machine cannot copy. 



The network says, *"Human Verified."* Instantly, Maya receives value. She didn't need a bank; she just needed to be alive. That is the **Great Wealth Transfer**.

## 🛠️ TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE (975A)
VCTR-SOV is a coordinate-agnostic settlement layer designed to prevent ad-fraud and verify real-world presence.

### 1. Stochastic Kinetic Verification (SKV)
Utilizing Inertial Kinetic Entropy (the non-linear "jitter" of a human gait) to generate a **Proof of Presence (PoP)** token.

### 2. The Lewis Threshold
The mathematical boundary established by the Architect to differentiate between mechanical (machine) movement and stochastic (human) movement.

### 3. The Universal Bridge
A cryptographic layer that decouples **Kinetic Proof of Humanity (KPoH)** from proprietary spatial indexes (Uber H3, Google S2). This allows a verified event to be settled on any grid simultaneously without proprietary lock-in.

​Algorithm Specification: > 
ENABLING TECHNOLOGY: THE UNIVERSAL BRIDGE
​System: A cryptographic settlement layer that decouples Kinetic Proof of Humanity (KPoH) from the spatial index.
​Functionality: Validates physics-based biological entropy (the "Wiggle") on the device.
​Outcome: A verified event that can be simultaneously assigned to Uber H3, Google S2, or custom sovereign grids without data leakage or proprietary lock-in.


# 🧬 TECHNICAL SPEC: THE LEWIS THRESHOLD [975A]
**Target:** Kinetic Entropy Verification (Sector 01)
**Protocol Standard:** 975ad5a

### 1. BIOLOGICAL ENTROPY (The Lewis Constant)
To verify a human signature, we measure the Stochastic Resonance of the sensor stream. Human biological jitter provides a high degree of entropy compared to mechanical oscillation.

**The Shannon Entropy ($H$) Calculation:**
$$H(X) = -\sum_{i=1}^{n} P(x_i) \log_2 P(x_i)$$

**Requirement:** The "Wiggle" must produce an entropy score $H > 0.82$. This is the "Lewis Constant." If $H < 0.82$, the system flags the input as a simulated/robotic signal.

---

### 2. SIGNAL PROCESSING (Power Spectral Density)
We utilize a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to analyze the frequency domain. This ensures the "Wiggle" contains biological micro-tremors (8–12 Hz) rather than a clean, artificial sine wave.

**The Power Spectral Density (PSD) Formula:**
$$P(f) = \frac{1}{T} |X(f)|^2$$

**Requirement:** The signature must show a "Dirty Harmonic." If the frequency peak is a perfect sine wave ($P(f)$ lacks noise components), the verification fails.

---

### 3. CRYPTOGRAPHIC BINDING (Hardware Lock)
To prevent "Replay Attacks" (using a recording of a previous wiggle), the movement data is salted with the device-unique hardware ID and a high-resolution timestamp.

**The Verification Hash:**
$$975A_{Hash} = SHA256(Kinetic_{Seed} + Device_{UUID} + Timestamp)$$

**Requirement:** The resulting hash must be unique to the specific device at that exact millisecond.

---

### 🛠️ IMPLEMENTATION SPECS
* **Sampling Rate:** 100Hz (Fixed Interval)
* **Data Fusion:** 3-Axis Accelerometer ($m/s^2$) + 3-Axis Gyroscope ($rad/s$)
* **Filtering:** High-pass filter ($> 0.5Hz$) to remove the gravity vector.
* **Success State:** UI Horizon line transitions to Gold (#FFD700).
