PUBLIC DISCLOSURE: STOCHASTIC KINETIC VERIFICATION (SKV) FOR COORDINATE-AGNOSTIC SPATIAL SETTLEMENT
​Inventor: Michael Joel Lewis (ID: 0489)
Publication Date: February 2, 2026
​Technical Field: This disclosure relates to geospatial verification and ad-fraud prevention in decentralized networks.
​The Problem: Current geospatial systems (e.g., Uber H3, Google S2) are siloed coordinate systems that rely on GPS data, which is easily spoofed. There is currently no method for a "Universal Participation" layer that validates a human's physical presence independent of these proprietary grids.
​The Solution (Universal Logic): This protocol utilizes Inertial Kinetic Entropy—the non-linear "jitter" or "wiggle" of a human gait captured by a device’s internal sensors (accelerometer/gyroscope)—to generate a Proof of Presence (PoP) token.
​Coordinate Agnosticism: The PoP token is generated at the hardware level prior to any geospatial mapping. This allows the verified human event to be settled on any underlying spatial index (H3, S2, or custom grids) simultaneously. The "Universal Bridge" logic ensures that the user remains a Sovereign Node rather than a tenant of a specific corporate grid.
