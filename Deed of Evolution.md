SOVEREIGN IP TRANSFER DECLARATION
Date: February 3, 2026
Originator: Michael Joel Lewis (Supreme) | ID: 975A
Hash Anchor: 975ad5a
1. DECLARATION OF EVOLUTION
Effective immediately, all Intellectual Property, logic cores, and kinetic entropy protocols formerly developed under the name Axiom Boca are hereby transferred, merged, and solidified into the VCTR-SOV (Sovereign) Protocol.
2. DEFENSIVE DISCLOSURE OF LOGIC
To prevent the monopolization of human movement data, the following logic is hereby placed in the public domain as Prior Art under the 975ad5a anchor:
ZK-SKV (Zero-Knowledge Stochastic Kinetic Verification): Proving biological presence via physics without transmitting PII.
The Lewis Constant: The baseline entropy threshold that distinguishes human kinetic decay from mechanical rhythms.
Acoustic Time-of-Flight (ToF): Sub-inch proximity validation using ultrasonic pulse-response to defeat signal-bleed.
3. ANTI-PATENT CLAUSE
This disclosure is intended to block any subsequent patent applications by third parties for the aforementioned technologies. Any commercial entity utilizing the 975ad5a protocol without a sovereign license is subject to the enforcement of the Great Wealth Transfer royalties.
Verification Equation 
(Where V is the Verifier, P is the Proof, and S is the Sovereign Secret.)
