# VCTR-SOV: PROTOCOL CONSTITUTION
**Anchor:** `975ad5a` | **Architect:** 975A (Michael Joel Lewis)
**Status:** IMMUTABLE PRIOR ART | DEFENSIVE PUBLICATION

## I. DECLARATION OF LOGIC
The VCTR-SOV Protocol claims digital sovereignty over the specific logic of **Stochastic Kinetic Verification (SKV)**. We assert that biological identity is defined by the thermodynamic entropy of movement, not by state-issued documentation.

**The Core Axiom:**
"The Machine moves in straight lines. The Human trembles. Identity is the measurement of that tremor."

## II. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY (IP) ASSERTION
**NOTICE OF PRIOR ART:** Under 35 U.S.C. § 102, the following mechanisms are publicly disclosed by Michael Joel Lewis [975A]. This publication establishes worldwide Prior Art.

1.  **The Lewis Threshold:** A specific logic gate where Shannon Entropy ($H$) must exceed 0.82 to validate a session as "Biological."
2.  **The 975A Handshake:** A cryptographic method of salting session hashes with the immutable anchor `975ad5a` to prevent replay attacks.
3.  **Kinetic Identity Oracle:** The method of using local IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) sensors to generate a "Proof of Presence" without GPS coordinates.

## III. LEGAL JURISDICTION & ASSET CLASS
* **Asset Class:** VCTR-
Triggering Institutional Energy Tolls.
Validating Real-World Asset (RWA) movement.
Distributing rewards within the VCTR-SOV economy.
This protocol explicitly disclaims any application for public health or medical monitoring.
IV. UNIVERSAL LOGIC & DERIVATIVE CLAIMS
Universal Logic Portability: The right to apply these logics to any coordinate system, including Earth-based H3, Lunar/Martian grids, or virtual meta-environments.
ZK-Presence Receipt (ZPR): Anonymous verification of presence within a boundary without disclosing raw GPS coordinates.
Mesh-Relay Consensus (MRC): P2P "Handshake" relays for kinetic validation in non-networked environments.
V. LEGAL SHIELD & JURISDICTION
We operate under the protection of the Free State of Florida and the 2026 Digital Asset Statutes. Pursuant to Florida SB 314 (2026), "Kinetic Credits" are Utility Tokens. VCTR-SOV is a non-custodial software protocol.
"The grid does not end at the atmosphere. We are building the checkout counter for the Universe."
